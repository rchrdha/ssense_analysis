    "<h2>by Richard Ha</h2>\n",
    "    <h3>Overview</h3><hr>This project aims to analyse the \"sale\" page of popular online luxury retail site SSENSE. The motivation for this endeavour is essentially to act as a proof-of-concept for a more detailed analysis of multi-dimensional sales data in the online luxury goods market.<br><br>I took a sample of roughly <b>1170 listings (1006 unique)</b> from the \"Sale\" page on SSENSE, under the menswear section and sorted by trending. The trending tab did not shift the order of listings within the data collection timeframe.<br><br>The main questions I wanted to be able to answer with this data analysis included but was not limited to the following inquiries:<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What type of items get discounted by the highest percentage?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Is there a correlation between country of manufacture and the sale percent? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Is there a pattern in how sale percentages are distributed across item subcategories?\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, I also want to test common consumer beliefs regarding luxury fashion consumption, and inspect whether links can be made between them and the Sale page data, like so:<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Does the country of origin affect the average base price of items? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Does black-coloured clothing get discounted by the least amount amongst other colours?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Although it is a topic that is seldom considered, (dis)proving it is a fairly sensible activity and is also of interest, with regards to understanding consumer behaviour a little bit better.\n",
    "    <h3>Underlying Assumptions and Remarks</h3><hr>\n",
    "    As this analysis is done through the user-side of things, there is no ultra-detailed sales data nor was there a program like Salesforce. The reason that the sample size is 1170 and not more was due to the website security disabling access to basic webscraping tools. <br><br> It's also worth mentioning that my underlying assumption in terms of drawing conclusions is the notion that when something is on sale, it is considered to be stock that needs to be moved. Primarily, in luxury fashion, it is due to a inventory surplus, usually by the item not selling, combined with the need to clear out inventory before the next season, in this case Fall-Winter 2023. It is definitely not the sole reason in why something goes on sale, but for the purposes of this project, it will act as such.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: Extract HTML Files from SSENSE Sale listings \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Process and clean HTML data using BeautifulSoup into categories\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Append values into Pandas series, which is then combined into a dataframe \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 4: Plotting datapoints according the some questions as above\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 5: Building and validating the model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 6: Data visualisation in clear, concise manner \n",
