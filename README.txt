Read through the notebooks in the following order:
    1. ssense_data_extraction.ipynb
    2. ssense_analysis.ipynb 

NOTE:
    - I did not upload all of the html files that was extracted from SSENSE purely because there is 1170 of them. The code in the first notebook works by parsing through all the html files with the assumption they are in the same working directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
    - I did upload some of the html files (up until the max GitHub allowed for a single upload) for anyone to download it themselves 


This is just the first version, will be making more, once I figure out how to extract more listings from SSENSE with basic webscraper tools.
